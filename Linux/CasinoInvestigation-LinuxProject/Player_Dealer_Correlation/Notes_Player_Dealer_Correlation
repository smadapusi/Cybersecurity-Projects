Summary:
=======

After Thorough Investigations and Analyzing the Roulette losses and dealer schedules that occurred 
on these three particular days 0310, 0312, 0315 and the times namely:

(a) 0310 - 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm
(b) 0312 - 5am, 8am, 2pm, 8pm and 11pm
(c) 0315 - 5am, 8am, 2pm

 - I see that one particular player is consistently playing these days and times when loss occured.
 - That player happens to be Mylie Schmidt".
 - Whenever Myli Schmidt played there was a loss to Lucky Duck Casino in these times and days.
 - Another Observation there is consistenly only one Dealer in that same time and day 
   when Mylie Schmidt is playing and that Dealer is "Biller Jones" for ROULETTES.
 - There are no other Roulette Dealer during those times when Mylie Schmidt plays in any of those three days.

This has lead me to believe and conclude that these two pair MYLIE SCHMIDT (Player) and BILLY JONES (Roulette Dealer)
have been colluding to scam Lucky Duck Casino.
